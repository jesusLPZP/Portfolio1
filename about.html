            <p> My name is Jesus Lopez and I will talk about myslef.
                I am a student in MSU Denver University and I am studying computer science.
                I am currently learning web development and this is my first website. 
                Before I even started in this computer science class I just enjoyed 
                spending time with my friends and family. Some of my hobies include 
                playing games, watching movies or series like Dexter, listening to music, 
                longboarding and working. I work at Vans shoe place because I really love 
                how comfortable and beutiful their shoes and shirts look like, highly 
                recomend their products.Finaly during my highschool years in Holy Famly, 
                I loved taking art class because I was able to create things like a paracord 
                belt, design my own leather belt and learned how to do stained glass.

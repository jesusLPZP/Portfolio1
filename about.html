          <p>
            My name is Jesus Lopez and I will talk about myslef. I am a student
            in MSU Denver University and I am studying computer science. I am
            currently learning web development and this is my first website.
            Before I even started in this computer science class I just enjoyed
            spending time with my friends and family. Some of my hobies include
            playing games, watching movies or series like Dexter, listening to
            music, longboarding and working. I work at Vans shoe place because I
            really love how comfortable and beutiful their shoes and shirts look
            like, highly recomend their products.Finaly during my highschool
            years in Holy Famly, I loved taking art class because I was able to
            create things like a paracord belt, design my own leather belt and
            learned how to do stained glass.
